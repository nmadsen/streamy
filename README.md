# streamy
Code worksheet to practice the java 8 streaming api

## HOW TO
In Winner.java, there are dozens of asserts that will fail until you supply the the correct combination of stream 
map, filter and collect calls.  
 
You'll see comments like this `// cool streaming code here`
That is were you put in the magic.  If the assert right after fails, then it isn’t quite right (theoretically).
 
If you get stuck, the completed code is on a different branch named “solution”
